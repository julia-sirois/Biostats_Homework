This homework will be practicing using the functions 'read.csv' and 'stringsAsFactors'

First let's set up a function to clear R's brain and the activate a few packages.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```

Now let's pull in our data

```{r}
DF <- read.csv(here("Data", "squirrels.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
glimpse(DF)
```
